//ðŸ”¹ Day 4: Functions and Methods

// Welcome to Day 4 of our Java programming journey! Today, we're diving into the world of functions and methods. These are like the building blocks of your code, allowing you to organize, reuse, and simplify your programs.

// ðŸ“… Functions
// Functions are self-contained blocks of code that perform a specific task. They promote code reusability and modularity, making your code easier to maintain.

// ðŸ“… Methods
// In Java, functions are called methods. We'll explore how to declare and call methods, pass arguments, and return values. You'll see how methods are essential for structuring Java programs.

// ðŸ“… Practice and Hands-On
// To truly grasp the power of functions and methods, we'll get hands-on experience by writing our own functions and methods, as well as using built-in ones.

// Get ready to supercharge your coding skills with functions and methods. It's all about making your code more efficient and readable!
