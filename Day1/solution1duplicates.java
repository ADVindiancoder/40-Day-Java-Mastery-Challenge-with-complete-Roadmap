//ðŸ“… Day 1: Variables, Data Types, and Operators
//This is the first day of our Java programming journey. Today, we will focus on the fundamental building blocks of Java: variables, data types, and operators.

//ðŸ“… Variables
//In Java, variables are used to store data. We will learn how to declare and initialize variables, including different data types like int, double, char, and more.

//ðŸ“… Data Types
//Understanding data types is crucial. We'll explore primitive data types (int, double, boolean, etc.) and reference data types (String), and discuss their use in Java programs.

//ðŸ“… Operators
//Operators are used for performing operations on variables and values. We'll cover arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), relational operators (>, <, ==), and logical operators (&&, ||), among others.

//ðŸ“… Type Casting
//Sometimes, you'll need to convert data from one type to another. We'll explain how type casting works in Java.

//ðŸ“… Expressions and Statements
//In Java, expressions and statements play a vital role in building your programs. We'll explore what they are and how to use them effectively.

//ðŸ“… Practice and Hands-On
//To solidify our understanding, we will work on practical exercises and coding examples to apply what we've learned today.
