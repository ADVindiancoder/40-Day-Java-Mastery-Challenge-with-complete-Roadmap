//ðŸ“… Day 2: Control Statements (if, switch, loops)
//On the second day of our Java programming journey, we'll delve into control statements. These are crucial for controlling the flow of your code based on different conditions.

//ðŸ“… if Statements
//We'll start with "if" statements, which allow you to execute code blocks conditionally. You can choose different paths based on whether a condition is true or false.

//ðŸ“… switch Statements
//"Switch" statements are handy when you have multiple conditions to evaluate against a single expression. We'll see how to use "switch" to make decisions efficiently.

//ðŸ“… for Loop
//The "for" loop is excellent for iterating through a range of values, such as arrays or when you know how many times you want to execute a block of code.

//ðŸ“… while Loop
//We'll explore the "while" loop, which repeatedly executes a code block as long as a specified condition remains true.

//ðŸ“… do-while Loop
//The "do-while" loop is similar to the "while" loop, but it ensures at least one execution of the code block, even if the condition is initially false.

//These control statements are powerful tools for building dynamic and responsive Java programs.

//ðŸ“… Practice and Hands-On
//To reinforce our knowledge, we will work on practical exercises and coding examples to apply what we've learned about control statements.
